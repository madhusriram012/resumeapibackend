# Resume Builder API backend

A Resume Builder API is a tool that allows users to create professional resumes quickly and easily. The API uses pre-built templates and dynamically generates the resume content based on the user's input data, such as personal information, skills, experiences, and education. This reduces the manual effort required to create and format a resume. The program for document Generation API is written in **node.js** using the SDK.

Possible Template Ids

-   1
-   2
-   3

# Output

The response from the API is stored as PDF under the output folder.

### Improvements

-   Adding rate-limit to the API calls
-   Adding deeper santization for all the json fields (e.g name field does not contain any illegal characters, max length etc.,)
-   This challenge does not consider security validation. The security validation like XSS including Markdown bypass
    SQL injections,NoSQL injections can be improved

### Possible errors

400 - Bad Request

404 - Template not found

401 - Unauthorized

500 - Internal Server error

 https://github.com/madhusriram012/resumeapifrontend
```
 and follow the commands over there.

### How to run test

        "phoneNumber": "+441238726384",
        "linkedInUrl": "https://linkedin.com/myprofile"
    },
    "templateId": "1",
    "jobTitle": "Software",
    "careerObjective": "To become leader",
    "skills": ["Java"],
    "education": [{
        "schoolName": "school",
        "passingYear": "2011-2013",
        "description": "my school"
    }],
    "experience": [{
        "companyName": " company",
        "passingYear": "2011-2013",
        "responsibilities": "responsibilities"
    }],
    "achievements": [{
        "field":"field",
        "awards":"awards"
    }]
}
```

possible Template Ids
* 1
* 2
* 3

### Improvements
* Adding rate-limit to the API calls
* Adding deeper santization for all the json fields (e.g name field does not contain any illegal characters, max length etc.,)
* This challenge does not consider security validation. The security validation like XSS including Markdown bypass
 SQL injections,NoSQL injections can be improved

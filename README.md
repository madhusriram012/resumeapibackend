    },
    "templateId": "1",
    "jobTitle": "Software",
    "careerObjective": "To become leader",
    "skills": ["Java"],
    "education": [{
        "schoolName": "school",

    }]
}
```
possible Template Ids
* 1
* 2
* 3


### Improvements
* Adding rate-limit to the API calls
* Adding deeper santization for all the json fields (e.g name field does not contain any illegal characters, max length etc.,)
* This challenge does not consider security validation. The security validation like XSS including Markdown bypass
 SQL injections,NoSQL injections can be improved
